To this end, I hereby authorize, without reservation, any law enforcement agency, administrator, state or federal agency, institution, school or university (public or private), information service bureau, employer, or insurance company to furnish any and all background information requested by Checkr, Inc., 2505 Mariposa St. Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94110 | 844-824-3247 | applicant.checkr.com.

Thus, you may be the subject of a “consumer report” and/or an “investigative consumer report” which may include information about your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and/or mode of living, and which can involve personal interviews with sources such as your neighbors, friends, or associates.  These reports may contain information regarding your criminal history, social security verification, motor vehicle records (“driving records”), verification of your education or employment history, or other background checks.</string>
    <string name="the_fcra_background_check_investigation_second_paragraph">You have the right, upon written request made within a reasonable time, to request whether a consumer report has been run about you, and disclosure of the nature and scope of any investigative consumer report and to request a copy of your report.  Please be advised that the nature and scope of the most common form of investigative consumer report is an employment history or verification.  These searches will be conducted by Checkr, Inc., 2505 Mariposa St. San Francisco, CA 94110 | 844–824–3247 | applicant.checkr.com.  The scope of this disclosure is all-encompassing, however, allowing the Company to obtain from any outside organization all manner of consumer reports throughout the course of your contract to the extent permitted by law.</string>
